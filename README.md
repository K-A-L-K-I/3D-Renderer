# 3D-Renderer
<b>My 3D Renderer Learning Journey</b><br>
This repository documents my journey of learning C++ and computer graphics by building a 3D renderer from scratch.<br><br>
<b>My Goal</b><br>
My goal is to understand the core concepts of 3D graphics, from vector math to rendering a final image, by building each component myself.<br><br>
<b>Current Status</b><br>
ðŸŒ± I am at the very beginning of my journey! I have set up the repository and am now starting to research the foundational concepts.<br><br>
<b>Learning Log (My Developer Diary)</b><br>
Here, I will keep a log of my progress, challenges, and discoveries.

Week 1
 * August 28, 2025
   * What I Did Today: Set up the initial GitHub repository with a README.md, .gitignore, and LICENSE file. Pinned the project to my profile.
   * What I Learned: I learned about the importance of a project README for documenting progress.
   * Next Steps: My next step is to research the basics of vector math and how to draw a single pixel to a window.
